# personalWebsite
This is where I will hold the code for my personal website that I will build from scratch with the help of some friends.

## Code that will have to be added
All the init.pys I figure it may as well be left till after all the rest of the code is finished.

## Blueprints
Blueprints create a way to separate code, and make link building and other things easier. I think benefits will be found in later developments of the app.

See the following link: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/blueprints/

Also we are using basing our application on the dream team example.
