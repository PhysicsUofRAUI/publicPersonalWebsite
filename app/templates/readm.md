# Purpose
This directory will hold all the HTML of the website.

## Needed Templates
### Base
Will contain the footer and the Nave Bar

### Blogs (travel and projects)
Will show the blog posts which will be either Travel or Projects page.

If it is the Travel page then the title of the page will be Travel and for Project it would be Project.

In the main body there will be two columns one for posts and one for categories. Jinja will be used to loop through all that is sent to the template and then displayed in the respective columns.

### Blog (add and edit)
Will display the add and edit forms for blogs.

See how the dream team example did it.

### PostSubCategory
Will display the add form for the subcategories of posts.

See how the dream team example did it.

### Gallery
Show the photos and captions.

Like the blog template there will be two columns one for photos and one for categories. Jinja will again be used to display the categories and photos.

### Photo
Will display the add and edit forms for the photos.

See how the dream team example did it.

### PhotoCategory
Will display the add form for inputing a new category for photos into the database.

See how the dream team example did it.

### Resume
Will contain the html that will extend the base template and create the resume page.

### Login
