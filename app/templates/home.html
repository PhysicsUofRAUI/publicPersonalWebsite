<h1>Who am I?</h1>

<p>
  I am a multi-disciplinary hacker in training. Currently I am looking for a job
  working in data analysis, web development, mobile application development or some
  other technology related job.
</p>
<p>
  Technical fields of particular interest to me is blockchain, internet of things,
  and data analysis. I beleive these three fields will feed off of each other creating
  new interesting innovations and business models. These three fields have the ability
  to do that because they compliment each other. The internet of things need to be secured
  and all the devices that are starting to appear need a way to communicate that everyone
  trusts, and blockchain can provide that. These connected devices will also be producing
  and collecting loads of data, and for that data to be utilized new data analysis techniques
  will have to be developed (e.g. Big Data, and Data mining). Eventually I would love
  to help usher in these new technologies but for now I will continue developing skills
  related to any three of those areas.
</p>
<p>
  If you are an employer who has opportunities in which I could do some useful work
  for you and develop my own skills please contact me at: rogers6k@uregina.ca

<h1>What is this Website?</h1>
<p>
I have built this website in part to show
that I can build a website from scratch, and as an example of how I accomplish something
like that.
</p>

<p>
  This website is divided into three main sections (Blogs, Photos, and Resume) which
  can be accessed via the navigation bar. Below I will explain what each section is and what
  I am trying to get across with them.
</p>
<h2>Blogs</h2>
<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>
  Travel has been a big part of my life so far shown by my travels to Brazil, Belgium,
  and Morocco. During each of my trips/adventures I have attempted to document the
  experience the best I can using Google's blogger. Those original blogs can be
  accessed at the following links:
  <ul>
    <li>Brazil: <a href="https://kodybrazil.blogspot.com/">https://kodybrazil.blogspot.com/</a></li>
    <li>Belgium: <a href="https://belgiuminternship.blogspot.com/">https://belgiuminternship.blogspot.com/</a></li>
    <li>Morocco: <a href="https://auimoroccoexchange.blogspot.com/">https://auimoroccoexchange.blogspot.com/</a></li>
  </ul>
  I am in the process of transfering all those blogs over to this site, but for now
  everthing is accessible on blogger. I also intend to rewrite all of the Brazil blogs
  and possibly the Morocco blogs, because my writing has greatly improved since I was
  on those exchanges.
</p>
<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>
  This tab will contain blog posts meant to document projects, such as this website,
  that I am working on. Other projects that I have or am working on are:
</p>
<h4>Travel Planning Website</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    A website built in a similar way to this except designed to help myself and
    possibly others to plan backpacking trips
  </li>
  <li>
    It will primarily use the WikiVoyage API to fetch possibly excursions restaurants
    etc. and then allow the user to save the selected outings
  </li>
  <li>
    A significant difference between the Travel Planning App and this website is
    that I intend to release the Travel Planning App to anyone wanting to plan their trip
    at a cost to be determined.
  </li>
  <li>
    The way this fits into my long term goals is that it allows me to grow my skills
    building products and as a programmer.
  </li>
  <li>Lots more to come!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bin Temperature Sensor</h4>
<p>
  As of right now farmers have two choices when it comes to grain monitoring either
  pay several thousand dollars per bin to have a computer monitor their grain or monitor
  it themselves. Monitoring themselves requires time and it is not that accurate
  so many times the farmer will end up with spoiled grain from the grain heating.
</p>
<p>
  It occured to me that the system that farmers can buy could be made with open source
  hardware platforms such as Arduino or Raspberry pi. I have set out to design
  these systems using open source hardware and then publish my results. During the
  December 2019, January and Feburary 2020 I made significant progress and even had a
  prototype running inside a empty bin. After that progress was made I slowed down,
  but now I intend to ramp back up on that proejct. See the blog for more recent
  updates and below for some relevant outside links!

</ul>
<h2>Photos</h2>
<p>
  This contains a selection of photos that I have collected overtime. Most of these
  photos are from my travels but possibly some from my projects my creep in. I may
  even put some in featuring my ice rink or wildlife.
</p>

<h2>Resume</h2>
<p>
  This contains webpage version of my resume for possible employers or someone
  who oddly enjoys looking at resumes for fun &#128540;
