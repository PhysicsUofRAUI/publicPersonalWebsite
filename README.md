# personalWebsite
This is where I will hold the code for my personal website that I will build from scratch with the help of some friends.

## Code that will have to be added
All the init.pys I figure it may as well be left till after all the rest of the code is finished.

## Blueprints
Blueprints create a way to separate code, and make link building and other things easier. I think benefits will be found in later developments of the app.

See the following link: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/blueprints/

Also we are using basing our application on the dream team example.

## Things To Do
Getting the error that querying the database in the forms.py form is out of context for the database.
Need to fix this. Probably easiest way is to move the query to the views.
